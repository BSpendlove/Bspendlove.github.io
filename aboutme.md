Hi, I'm Brandon.

This is a blog where I either express my own expertise on topics related around my job/interests or use as a personal notebook related to networking, virtualization, programming, whatever... you name it.

I get excited talking about protocols, packet header formats, fibre standards, strings, integers and food.

Feel free to contact me at brandon.spendlove [at] veesix-networks.co.uk if you find my blog interesting or want to correct a mistake...
